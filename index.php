    <h2>Get ready to eat the best food in town!</h2>
    <p>Retro Diner is a low key, authentic diner experience.  Here we like our meat and our cheese... and frequently mixed.  You don't get many opportunities to eat a Hamburger pie in the city, so here is your chance!  We are known for all things comfort-food.</p>
<p>Recently Guy Fiere featured our diner on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  He completed the Roast Beef Challenge... can you?</p>
